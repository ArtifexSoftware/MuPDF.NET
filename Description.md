MuPDF.NET adds .NET bindings and abstractions to MuPDF, a lightweight PDF, XPS, and eBook viewer, renderer, and toolkit.
MuPDF.NET allows programs written in any .NET supported language, like C#, Visual Basic .NET or F# to access MuPDF features in the same way as the Python bindings [PyMuPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/).
MuPDF.NET, PyMuPDF and MuPDF are maintained and developed by Artifex Software, Inc.
