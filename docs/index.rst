.. note::


    |MuPDF.NET| has been derived from `PyMuPDF <https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF>`_ and it closely follows its structure. So for most of |PyMuPDF|'s classes, features and functions you will find a respective |MuPDF.NET| object doing the same sort of thing.


    Please note that there are deviations as per how objects are named. We will publish a table in due time that maps |MuPDF.NET| and |PyMuPDF| names.
